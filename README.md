Small-scale farmers often lack real-time access to market prices and buyer availability. As a result, they sell at low prices or miss opportunities to profit. They need a platform that alerts them of local market prices and connects them with buyers nearby.
ShambaLink project aims at solving this problem to connect farmers to ready market with informed updates.
